Overview
=============
This sample code provides guidance on how to use the Custom Translator API using ASP.NET MVC application. Refer to [Custom Translator documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/cognitive-services/translator/custom-translator/overview) to know more about different features of Custom Translator. 

Current API documentation of Custom Translator API can be found [here](https://custom-api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/swagger/).

Prerequisites
=============

Create and Register your Azure AD Client App
--------------------------------------------

This sample code uses OAuth and OpenID for authentication. Please sign in to
<https://apps.dev.microsoft.com> with the same user credentials you use to login
to Custom Translator. The landing page shows the list of client apps that are
created/ available to use with your account.

Create an app using **Add an app** button at top right-hand corner of the landing
page.

Enter application name and click on **Create**.

![Client app registration](media/e90a645b51ab87c3be1002ea553beae1.png)

Generate a new password and keep it safe. This is the **Application Secret**, and
will be used in the application for authentication.

When an application is created, the default delegated permission for it are **User.Read**.
Add two additional delegated permissions 
- **offline_access** 
- **openid**.

Go to **Microsoft Graph Permissions**, the **Delegated Permissions** in the page to add these permissions.

For the MVC web application, a new “Web” platform needs to be added from
“Platforms” section of the page.

Enter the **Redirect URLs** for the web platform. This URL is where your MVC web app
should redirect after authentication. You can change Redirect URLs based on your application configuration.

Now save the changes you made and the portal will take you to the landing page,
where all your registered applications are listed. The **App Id/ Client ID** listed here will be used to authenticate in the MVC web app.

login to accept the terms and conditions.
