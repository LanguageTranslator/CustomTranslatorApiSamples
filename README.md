Prerequisites
=============

Create and Register your Azure AD Client App
--------------------------------------------

This sample code uses OAuth and OpenID for authentication. Please login to
<https://apps.dev.microsoft.com> with the same user credentials you use to login to 
Custom Translator. The landing page shows the list of client apps that are created/
available to use with your account.

Create an app using “Add an app” button at top right hand corner of the landing
page.

Enter application name and click on “Create”.

![](media/e90a645b51ab87c3be1002ea553beae1.png)

Generate a new password and keep it safe. This is the Application Secret, and
will be used in the application for authentication.

When an application is created the default delegated permission for it are
“User.Read”.

Please add two additional delegated permissions (a) offline_access (b) openid.
These can be added from the “Microsoft Graph Permissions \>\> Delegated Permissions”
section in the page.

For the MVC web application a new “Web” platform needs to be added from
“Platforms” section of the page.

Please enter the redirect URL for the web platform. This is the URL where your
MVC web app should redirect after authentication.

You can ignore the logout URL field.

Now save the changes you made and the portal will take you to the landing page,
where all your registered applications are listed. The App Id/ Client Id listed here
will be used to authenticate in the MVC web app.

account you used to create/register the AAD app), you will need to login to accept 
the terms and conditions.
